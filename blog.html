                Iceland - 100,000km2 of dramatic landscapes filled with volcanoes, geysers, black sand beaches, lava fields, and the most expensive gas stations sandwiches you could ever imagine.

            <p>
                Iceland will forever hold a special place in my heart as my first stop on my two-month long backpacking expedition across Europe in 2015. Won-over by Icelandair’s free 7-day stopover in Reykjavik en-route to London, my brother and I arrived at Keflavik International Airport without our luggage and delirious after numerous delayed flights, which made the bright summer evening sky even more disorientating.

                Knowing what I know now about travel, I would have prepared for Iceland a little differently. Shocked by the cost of food on the island, I ate my entire two-month supply of protein bars in one week in an effort to save money on food. We had rented the cheapest two-wheel drive car we could find - not the best decision when the majority of Iceland’s roads are either gravel, soft dirt, ice, water, or all of the above. We vastly underestimated the time it takes to drive anywhere around the island, but luckily the endless summer daylight favoured us.

                Regardless, Iceland is still one of my favourite countries to date and I can’t wait to go back one day and explore the remaining parts which I wasn’t able to see. WIthout further a do, here are my favourite experiences of Iceland.
